# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project investigates machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. By analyzing historical data, we aim to build a model that can flag suspicious activity in real-time, protecting users from financial loss.

Key aspects:

Explore various machine learning algorithms for classification.
Address class imbalance inherent in fraud datasets.
Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics.
